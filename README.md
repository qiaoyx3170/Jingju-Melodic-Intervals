### Topic: Research on Melodic Intervals in Vocal Parts of Jingju  
Author: Yuxi Qiao, Betty Corti√±as

In this project we aim at analyzing the most frequent melodic contours in Jingju vocal parts for sequences of three consecutive notes ocurring on the same syllable, in terms of the nature of the intervals between them, namely, interval class and direction.  

The idea is to count the intervals formed by three consecutive notes in the vocal part within each syllable.
